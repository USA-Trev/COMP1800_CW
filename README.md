This is my coursework implementation for a Data Visualization class I took while obtaining my Master's degree.

The data being visualized comes from a fictional company called ChrisCo. The dataset is composed of data from ChrisCo's forty stores, each identified by a unique three-letter code.
There are 5 files in the dataset.

1. DailyCustomers.csv - Contains the number of daily customers each store had over a one-year period.
2. StoreMarketing.csv - Contains the amount of money each store spent annually for marketing.
3. StoreOverheads.csv - Contains the amount of money each store spent annually for non-essential purposes.
4. StoreSize.csv - Contains the size (floor space) of each store in square meters.
5. StoreStaff.csv - Contains the number of staff members employed at each store.

To view the entire project:
1. download the project files from the repository.
2. open COMP1800_CW.ipynb in Google Colab.
3. upload the 5 CSV files to the Colab notebook.
4. Ctrl + F9 to run all cells.
